                <h1>What's a Gundam?</h1>
                <p>A Gundam is an advanced, high performance mobile suit, often constructed to 
                    be much more powerful than the standard production mobile suits. They are 
                    generally equipped with the latest experimental technology available at the 
                    time of their construction. The definition of a Gundam varies from one timeline 
                    to another. In most series it is used as an acronym to refer to something, however 
                    in all but the most recent series these acronyms were derived after the fact and do 
                    not appear at any point in the animated works. The protagonist's mobile suit of a series 
                    usually carries the name Gundam. The main suit in each series usually sports a mainly white 
                    and blue color scheme, with yellow and red accents, and sports at least one pair of yellow or 
                    white V-fins on its head.</p>
